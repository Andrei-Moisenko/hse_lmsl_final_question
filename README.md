# Question
_Given map-reduce sequence of tasks, what would be the algorithm to convert it into Spark, can one improve it in speed?_

# Answer
To convert a traditional map-reduce sequence of tasks into PySpark, we can use the `map` and `reduceByKey` transformations. PySpark's rdds support similar operations to traditional MapReduce, but with a more efficient approach.

Here's an example approach to converting a map-reduce sequence into spark and optimizing for speed:

## 1. Use `map` and `reduceByKey` Transformations
MapReduce typically involves mapping data to key-value pairs and then reducing them based on the key. In PySpark, we can perform similar operations with `map` and `reduceByKey`.

For example, if we have a task to count word occurrences, we can implement it as follows:

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext

sc = SparkContext()

# Input RDD
lines = sc.parallelize(["hello world", "hello PySpark", "hello hse"])

# Map step: Split each line into words and create (word, 1) pairs
word_counts = lines.flatMap(lambda line: line.split()).map(lambda word: (word, 1))

# Reduce step: Sum up counts by key (word)
result = word_counts.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)

# Collect and display the result
print(result.collect())
```

## 2. Optimize with `combineByKey` for Complex Aggregations
If our task involves aggregating values in a more complex way than simple addition, we can consider `combineByKey`. It is useful for tasks like calculating average values, where we need to handle multiple types of operations (e.g., summing counts and calculating totals) in one pass.

For example, to calculate the average length of words grouped by the first letter:

```python
# Map step: Create key-value pairs (first letter, (word length, 1))
letter_word_lengths = lines.flatMap(lambda line: line.split()).map(lambda word: (word[0], (len(word), 1)))

# Combine step: Use combineByKey to sum lengths and counts for averaging
avg_word_length_by_letter = letter_word_lengths.combineByKey(
    lambda value: (value[0], value[1]),   # Initial aggregation (length, count)
    lambda acc, value: (acc[0] + value[0], acc[1] + value[1]),  # Merge within partition
    lambda acc1, acc2: (acc1[0] + acc2[0], acc1[1] + acc2[1])   # Merge across partitions
).mapValues(lambda acc: acc[0] / acc[1])  # Compute average

print(avg_word_length_by_letter.collect()) # collect result
```

## 3. Use `DataFrame` API for Further Speed and Optimization
The DataFrame API in PySpark, which is built on Spark SQL, provides several optimizations that can improve performance, such as Catalyst (query optimization) and Tungsten (in-memory computation). If our tasks fit into SQL-style operations, we can consider converting our RDD to a DataFrame and using the DataFrame API for better performance. Moreover DataFrame operating syntax is more convenient :) 

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions as f

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("lsml_example").getOrCreate()

# Create a DataFrame from lines
lines_df = spark.createDataFrame(lines, "string").toDF("line")

# Split each line into words, explode into individual rows, and count
word_counts_df = lines_df.select(f.explode(f.split(lines_df.line, " ")).alias("word")) \
                         .groupBy("word") \
                         .count()

word_counts_df.show() # show the result
```

## 4. Cache Intermediate Results for Reuse
If we reuse the same RDD multiple times in our pipeline, we can consider caching it to avoid recomputation.

```python
# Cache the RDD to use it multiple times
word_counts.cache()
```

## 5. Parallelize with Wider Partitions
Using a higher number of partitions can improve parallelism, especially if we are working with a large dataset. This is particularly important in Spark, as it allows better distribution across the cluster nodes.

```python
# Increase number of partitions for larger data. not required for our example though
lines = sc.parallelize(["hello world", "hello PySpark", "hello hse"], numPartitions=100)
```

## Summary
Using `reduceByKey` or `combineByKey`, leveraging DataFrames where possible, caching results, and increasing partitions we can  improve the speed of traditional MapReduce tasks in Spark.
